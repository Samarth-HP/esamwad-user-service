Samagraâ€™s User Service provides some basic set of functionalities, easy to integrate apis and various authentication strategies to authenticate users to your application. You can directly use an instance of User Service in your application to access these services. With this, your users can sign in to a web or mobile app instantly through User service. It supports authentication using Passwords, Phone number, Bit password as well as additional services such as Forget/Reset password, Providing Role based access control (RBAC) to users within an enterprise, User creation &  various CRUD operations on a user.

### Use Cases

Similarly, e-Samwad is a flagship program of the Department of Education, Himachal Pradesh to involve parents in child's education by providing them regular updates about child's progress. It is an android app which also uses the same instance of User service for its registration portal. As you can see, User service components are reusable and can be easily re-integrate into different applications smoothly. As all the user credentials are stored centrally on a server hosted by Samagra, the developer need not worry about managing server hardware and creating a separate authentication software from scratch.
