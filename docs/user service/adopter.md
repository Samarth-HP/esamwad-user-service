4. Download [Visual Studio](https://code.visualstudio.com/download). This project is built on VSCode and would be developed only with this IDE in mind. The [.vscode](https://github.com/Samarth-HP/esamwad-user-service/blob/master/.vscode) directory will keep updating with all the VSCode magic.

5. To start User service in development mode, move inside the cloned repository and run the following command:
